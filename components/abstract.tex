Graph signal recovery is a central task in graph signal processing, with applications across diverse networked data domains. 
Graph Laplacian regularization (GLR) is a well-established approach for smooth signal recovery, but it heavily relies on an assumption that rarely holds: edge weights accurately reflect signal characteristics.
Graph total variation (GTV) offers more robustness to weight uncertainties but under-penalizes small differences on reliable edges, limiting its effectiveness.
We propose a novel infimal convolution–based regularizer that adaptively combines the strengths of GLR and GTV. 
Reliable edges with small signal differences are effectively handled by the quadratic component, while unreliable edges with larger differences are better explained by the $\ell_{1}$ component. 
This mechanism enables robust recovery in the presence of edge weight uncertainties without sacrificing performance when weights are accurate.
We formulate recovery as a convex optimization problem and develop an efficient solver via a preconditioned primal–dual splitting method. 
Experiments on graph signal recovery with perturbed edge weights show that our approach consistently outperforms GLR and GTV, achieving robust and accurate recovery under uncertainty.
