We now introduce a regularization framework that promotes signal smoothness on the underlying true graph while mitigating the adverse effects of edge weight uncertainties. 
Based on this design, we formulate graph signal recovery as a convex optimization problem and develop an efficient algorithm to solve it using P-PDS.
